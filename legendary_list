/// [Á Bao A Qu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bao_A_Qu)(Malay) – Entity that lives in the Tower of Victory in Chitor.
ABaoAQu[A Bao A Qu is a legendary Mewar creature described in Jorge Luis Borges's 1967 Book of Imaginary Beings. Borges claimed to have found it either in an introduction to the Arabian Nights by Richard Francis Burton, or in the book On Malay Witchcraft (1937) by C.C. Iturvuru. The Burton reference was given in the original Spanish, but it was changed to the Iturvuru reference in the English text, possibly to make it sound more exotic, or as a reference to Borges' friend C. C. Iturburu. The writer Antares conjectures that Borges's tale might be inspired by Orang Asli myth, and that 'A Bao A Qu' is a slurring of abang aku meaning 'my elder brother'.  In Borges's story, the A Bao A Qu lives on the steps of the Tower of Victory in Chitor, from the top of which one can see 'the loveliest landscape in the world'. The A Bao A Qu waits on the first step for a man brave enough to try to climb up. Until that point, it lies sleeping, shapeless and translucent, until someone passes. Then, when a man starts climbing, the creature wakes, and follows close behind. As it progresses further and further up, it begins to become clearer and more colorful. It gives off a blue light which increases as it ascends. But it only reaches perfection when the climber reaches the top, and achieves Nirvana, so his acts don't cast any shadows. But almost all the time, the climber cannot reach the top, for they are not perfect. When the A Bao A Qu realizes this, it hangs back, losing color and visibility, and tumbles back down the staircase until it reaches the bottom, once more dormant and shapeless. In doing so, it gives a small cry, so soft that it sounds similar to the rustling of silk. When touched, it feels like the fuzz on the skin of a peach. Only once in its everlasting life has the A Bao A Qu reached its destination at the top of the tower.]
/// [Aatxe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aatxe)(Basque) – Bull spirit.
Aatxe[Aatxe is a spirit in the folk mythology of the Basque people. His name is literally translated as 'Young Bull', and he is sometimes known as Etsai. He is a cave-dwelling spirit who adopts the form of a young red bull, but being a shapeshifter, sometimes takes the shape of a man. At night, more so in stormy weather, he arises from the hollow which is his lair. He attacks criminals and other malevolent people. He also protects people by making them stay home when danger is near. He is theorized to be a representative of the goddess Mari, or may be an enforcer of her will, punishing people who cheat her. Another name for him is Aatxegorri which means 'young red bull'. It is believed Aatxe inhabited caves and hollows; in many (Isturits, Sare, Errenteria, among others) engravings and paintings depicting aurochs, bulls, and oxen have been found; which implies that this Basque myth has its origins in the Paleolithic.]
/// [Abaasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abasy)(Yakuts) – Iron-toothed demons.
Abaasy[The Abaasy (Abaahy or Abasy, Yakut: Aбаасы, Abaası; Dolgan: Абааһы, Abaahı; Azerbaijani: Abası; Turkish: Abası; Hungarian: Abaaszi; Bulgarian: Абааси, Abaasi; Russian: Абасы, Abasy; cognate of the Turkic word Abası) are demons in the mythology of the Sakha (also known as the Yakuts). Yakut Shamanism divides the universe into upper and lower layers, with the earth being 'a kind of indeterminate space or matter' in between. The abaasy occupy the lower level, referred to as the underworld or 'kingdom of darkness.'  The abaasy are alleged to be the spirits of the long-time deceased who dwell near graves or in deserted places who otherwise travel about causing destruction. They serve Arson-Duolai, the ruler of the dead, who also swallows people' souls and gives the living diseases. The abaasy can be appeased by blood sacrifices.  The abaasy have been depicted as causing sexual manifestations and madness.]
/// [Äbädä](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%84b%C3%A4d%C3%A4)(Tatar) – Forest spirit.
Abada[Äbädä is an innocent forest spirit in Tatar mythology. It looks like an old woman. Äbädä also is represented in mythologies of Siberian peoples.Äbädä is a demon or spirit. He is a Turkic forest being, similar in nature to the İyes. He protects the birds, trees, and animals of the forest; he appears in the shape of a human with blue skin, two great horns, green hair, and a long green beard across his face, carrying a club or whip indicating his mastery of the forest. He can shapeshift into many different forms. As a human, he looks like a peasant with glowing eyes, and his shoes are on backwards. Should one ever encounter an Äbädä, one must thwart him immediately by turning all one's clothes inside out and backwards, and placing one's shoes on the opposite feet.]
/// [Abaia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abaia)(Tatar) – Forest spirit. (Melanesia) – Huge magical eel.
Abaia[Abaia is a huge, magical eel in Melanesian mythology.  According to Melanesian mythology the Abaia is a type of large eel which dwells at the bottom of freshwater lakes in the Fiji, Solomon and Vanuatu Islands. The Abaia is said to consider all creatures in the lake its children and protects them furiously against anyone who would harm or disturb them. It is said that those who are foolish enough to try to catch the fish from a lake containing the Abaia are immediately overwhelmed by a large wave caused by the thrashing of the Abaia's powerful tail.  Another version of the legend states that if someone were to harm a creature living in the Abaia's home, the Abaia would cause a great rain storm flooding the land and drowning those who had caused the harm. One example of this ability is illustrated in the following story:    One day a man discovered a lake in which were many fish, and at the bottom of the lake lived a magic eel, but the man knew it not. He caught many fish and returned the next day with the people of his village whom he had told of his discovery, and they also were very successful, while one woman even laid hold of the great eel, Abaia, who dwelt in the depths of the lake, though he escaped her. Now Abaia was angry that his fish had been caught and that he himself had been seized, so he caused a great rain to fall that night, and the waters of the lake also rose, and all the people were drowned except an old woman who had not eaten of the fish and who saved herself in a tree.  Although it would seem that the magical powers of the Abaia are the byproduct of human imagination and its fear of the unknown, it has been suggested that the Abaia legend may have stemmed from encounters with an actual undiscovered species of giant eel living at the bottom of these remote lakes.]
/// [Abarimon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abarimon)(Medieval Bestiaries) – Savage humanoid with backward feet. 
Abarimon[Abarimon or antipode in mythology are people whose feet are turned backwards, but in spite of this handicap were able to run at great speed.  In Europe, this tribe was first described by Pliny the Elder, in his book, Natural History (VII 11), who considered them to be native to India. A similar tale is recounted by Aulus Gellius in Attic Nights.  They lived side by side with wild animals and attempts to capture them failed because they were so savage. Pliny refers to information that originates from Baiton, which was Alexander the Great's Land Surveyor. Baiton says that the abarimons could only breathe the air in their own domestic valleys. Because of the special quality of air, which meant if it was breathed for a long period of time, it would be impossible to breathe any other type of air. Therefore the inhabitants were unable to leave the valley and live anywhere else. And so it was impossible to capture them and bring them to the courts of a distant ruler, or to the great Macedonian conquest.  It is possible that this is an overly designed ethnographic description of an ancient wildlife strain in the areas near Himalayas.  According to another legend, Abarimon is mentioned as a landscape in Scythia, a valley of Mount Imaus, (which may be identical to Hindukush or the Himalayan Mountains).Later, Abarimon has been briefly described in Thomas Cooper's Thesaurus Linguae Romanae et Britannicae, as a tribe in the country Tataria . During the Middle Ages, some mapdrawers, after a familiar heliocentric view, have made monsters in the form of Abarimon people and placed them at the outer border of the world.]
/// [Abath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abath)(Malay) – One-horned animal.
Abath[An Abath is a legendary creature resembling a unicorn, first appearing in records in the 16th century.  Accounts of the Abath were brought back by 16th-century European travellers to the Malay Peninsula. Described as female, with a single horn growing from its forehead, it is speculated that these were probably the result of a half-glimpsed Javan or Sumatran rhinoceros. Like the unicorn, a powder made from this horn supposedly served both as an aphrodisiac and as an antidote to poison. However, since the unicorn was invariably represented as male, and since there was only ever one in existence at any time, the Abath seems to have developed independently from the European myths of the one-horned creature.]
/// [Abura-sumashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abura-sumashi)(Japanese) – Creature from a mountain pass in Kumamoto Prefecture.
AburaSumashi[This spirit, which surprises people on the Kusazumigoe mountain pass, is thought to be the ghost of a human who stole oil.      In the days before electricity, oil was a very valuable commodity, necessary for lighting and heating a house. As such, the theft of oil, particularly from temples and shrines, could lead to punishment via reincarnation as a yōkai.  In modern media the abura-sumashi is often depicted as, 'a squat creature with a straw-coat covered body and a potato-like or stony head,' an appearance inspired by the artwork of Shigeru Mizuki.]
/// [Acephali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_men)(Greek) – Headless humanoids.
Acephali[Various species of mythical headless men were rumoured, in antiquity and later, to inhabit remote parts of the world. They are variously known as akephaloi (Greek ἀκέφαλοι, 'headless ones') or Blemmyes (Latin: Blemmyae; Greek: βλέμμυες) and described as lacking a head, with their facial features on their chest. These were at first described as inhabitants of ancient Libya or the Nile system (Aethiopia). Later traditions confined their habitat to a particular island in the Brisone River, or shifted it to India.  Blemmyes are said to occur in two types: with eyes on the chest or with the eyes on the shoulders. Epiphagi, a variant name for the headless people of the Brisone, is sometimes used as a term referring strictly to the eyes-on-the-shoulders type. ]

EasterBunny[The Easter Bunny (also called the Easter Rabbit or Easter Hare) is a folkloric figure and symbol of Easter, depicted as a rabbit—sometimes dressed with clothes—bringing Easter eggs. Originating among German Lutherans, the 'Easter Hare' originally played the role of a judge, evaluating whether children were good or disobedient in behavior at the start of the season of Eastertide, similar to the 'naughty or nice' list made by Santa Claus. As part of the legend, the creature carries colored eggs in its basket, as well as candy, and sometimes toys, to the homes of children. As such, the Easter Bunny again shows similarities to Santa (or the Christkind) and Christmas by bringing gifts to children on the night before a holiday. The custom was first mentioned in Georg Franck von Franckenau's De ovis paschalibus ('About Easter eggs') in 1682, referring to a German tradition of an Easter Hare bringing eggs for the children.]
/// [Easter Bilby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Bilby)(Australian) – Anthropomorphic bilby.
EasterBilby[Bilbies are native Australian marsupials that are endangered. To raise money and increase awareness of conservation efforts, bilby-shaped chocolates and related merchandise are sold within many stores throughout Australia as an alternative to Easter bunnies.  The first documented use of the Easter Bilby concept was in March 1968 when a 9-year-old girl Rose-Marie Dusting, wrote a story, 'Billy The Aussie Easter Bilby,' which she published as a book 11 years later. The story helped catalyse the public's interest in saving the bilby. In 1991, Nicholas Newland from the 'Foundation for Rabbit-Free Australia' also developed the idea of the Easter Bilby to raise awareness about the environmental damage that feral rabbits cause and to replace the Easter bunny with true native wildlife.  The first Chocolate Easter Bilbies were sold at the Warrawong Sanctuary when it was owned by John Wamsley]

It usually takes the form of a horse, and is similar to the kelpie but far more vicious.]

/// [Santa Claus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus)(North Pole-European folklore) – Elderly man who delivers gifts to well-behaved children on the night of Christmas Eve
SantaClaus[Santa Claus, also known as Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, Saint Nick, Kris Kringle, or simply Santa, is a legendary character originating in Western Christian culture who is said to bring gifts on Christmas Eve of toys and candy to well-behaved children, and either coal or nothing to naughty children. He is said to accomplish this with the aid of Christmas elves, who make the toys in his workshop at the North Pole, and flying reindeer who pull his sleigh through the air.  The modern character of Santa Claus was based on traditions surrounding the historical Saint Nicholas (a fourth-century Greek bishop and gift-giver of Myra), the English figure of Father Christmas, and the Dutch figure of Sinterklaas (also based on Saint Nicholas).  Santa Claus is generally depicted as a portly, jolly, white-bearded man, often with spectacles, wearing a red coat with white fur collar and cuffs, white-fur-cuffed red trousers, red hat with white fur, and black leather belt and boots, carrying a bag full of gifts for children. He is commonly portrayed as laughing in a way that sounds like 'ho ho ho'. This image became popular in the United States and Canada in the 19th century due to the significant influence of the 1823 poem 'A Visit from St. Nicholas'. Caricaturist and political cartoonist Thomas Nast also played a role in the creation of Santa's image. This image has been maintained and reinforced through song, radio, television, children's books, family Christmas traditions, films, and advertising. ]

Valkyrie[In Norse mythology, a valkyrie (/vælˈkɪəri, -ˈkaɪri, vɑːl-, ˈvælkəri/; from Old Norse valkyrja, 'chooser of the slain') is one of a host of female figures who choose those who may die in battle and those who may live. Selecting among half of those who die in battle (the other half go to the goddess Freyja's afterlife field Fólkvangr), the valkyries take their chosen to the afterlife hall of the slain, Valhalla, ruled over by the god Odin. There, the deceased warriors become einherjar (Old Norse 'single (or once) fighters'). When the einherjar are not preparing for the events of Ragnarök, the valkyries bear them mead. Valkyries also appear as lovers of heroes and other mortals, where they are sometimes described as the daughters of royalty, sometimes accompanied by ravens and sometimes connected to swans or horses.  Valkyries are attested in the Poetic Edda (a book of poems compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources), the Prose Edda, the Heimskringla (both by Snorri Sturluson) and the Njáls saga (one of the Sagas of Icelanders), all written—or compiled—in the 13th century. They appear throughout the poetry of skalds, in a 14th-century charm, and in various runic inscriptions.  The Old English cognate terms wælcyrge and wælcyrie appear in several Old English manuscripts, and scholars have explored whether the terms appear in Old English by way of Norse influence, or reflect a tradition also native among the Anglo-Saxon pagans. Scholarly theories have been proposed about the relation between the valkyries, the Norns, and the dísir, all of which are supernatural figures associated with fate. Archaeological excavations throughout Scandinavia have uncovered amulets theorized as depicting valkyries. In modern culture, valkyries have been the subject of works of art, musical works, comic books, video games and poetry.]@50,10,1,10,10,7,20,20,20,30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10@

The Vâlve are believed to walk over the hilltops at night, and are subdivided into Vâlve Albe ('White Vâlve'), who are considered beneficial, and Vâlve Negre ('Black Vâlve' or 'Dark Vâlve'), who are considered evil. In certain contexts, they are believed to have human form (especially when they came to protect villages from a storm). They may also appear under various guises, such as shadows or black cats.

/// [Werewolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolf)(Worldwide) – Wolf-human shapeshifter
Werewolf[In folklore, a werewolf (Old English: werwulf, 'man-wolf'), or occasionally lycanthrope /ˈlaɪkənˌθroʊp/ (Greek: λυκάνθρωπος lukánthrōpos, 'wolf-human'), is a human with the ability to shapeshift into a wolf (or, especially in modern film, a therianthropic hybrid wolflike creature), either purposely or after being placed under a curse or affliction (often a bite or scratch from another werewolf) with the transformations occurring on the night of a full moon. Early sources for belief in this ability or affliction, called lycanthropy /laɪˈkænθrəpi/, are Petronius (27–66) and Gervase of Tilbury (1150–1228).  The werewolf is a widespread concept in European folklore, existing in many variants, which are related by a common development of a Christian interpretation of underlying European folklore developed during the medieval period. From the early modern period, werewolf beliefs also spread to the New World with colonialism. Belief in werewolves developed in parallel to the belief in witches, in the course of the Late Middle Ages and the Early Modern period. Like the witchcraft trials as a whole, the trial of supposed werewolves emerged in what is now Switzerland (especially the Valais and Vaud) in the early 15th century and spread throughout Europe in the 16th, peaking in the 17th and subsiding by the 18th century.  The persecution of werewolves and the associated folklore is an integral part of the 'witch-hunt' phenomenon, albeit a marginal one, accusations of lycanthropy being involved in only a small fraction of witchcraft trials.  During the early period, accusations of lycanthropy (transformation into a wolf) were mixed with accusations of wolf-riding or wolf-charming. The case of Peter Stumpp (1589) led to a significant peak in both interest in and persecution of supposed werewolves, primarily in French-speaking and German-speaking Europe. The phenomenon persisted longest in Bavaria and Austria, with persecution of wolf-charmers recorded until well after 1650, the final cases taking place in the early 18th century in Carinthia and Styria.  After the end of the witch-trials, the werewolf became of interest in folklore studies and in the emerging Gothic horror genre; werewolf fiction as a genre has pre-modern precedents in medieval romances (e.g. Bisclavret and Guillaume de Palerme) and developed in the 18th century out of the 'semi-fictional' chap book tradition. The trappings of horror literature in the 20th century became part of the horror and fantasy genre of modern popular culture.]

Scamander was also said to have attempted to kill Achilles three times, and the hero was only saved due to the intervention of Hera, Athena and Hephaestus. In this context, he is the personification of the Scamander River that flowed from Mount Ida across the plain beneath the city of Troy, joining the Hellespont north of the city. The Achaeans, according to Homer, had set up their camp near its mouth, and their battles with the Trojans were fought on the plain of Scamander. In Iliad XXII (149ff), Homer states that the river had two springs: one produced warm water; the other yielded cold water, regardless of the season.  According to Homer, he was called Xanthos by gods and Scamander by men, which might indicate that the former name refers to the god and the latter one to the river itself.]
