Aren't the buildings here so lovely!
I really like the style of architecture here, isn't is nice!
This is my favorite spot in the entire city!
Have you seen the sunrise over those buildings?  It is wonderful!
Have you been to the library?  I always try to find one.
You really should stay in town for a while, this city is so beautiful!
