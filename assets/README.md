# Assets
All the configuration files toml/ini/etc are released into the public domain.

# Contributing
Most of the creatures from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_legendary_creatures) do **not** have actual stats, nor a full description.
This is the area the most help is needed

# Charts

The files `npc-chart.fl` and `type-effectiveness.fl` can be opened/edited using [FLTK's FLUID](https://crates.io/crates/fltk-fluid)

I have been using FLTK for years and FLUID is an easy way to mockup designs like that.  I thought about using `inkscape` but FLUID will allow me/anyone to create a GUI configuration utility for user files at some point using FLTK + Rust.
