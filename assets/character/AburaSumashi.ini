[AburaSumashi]
name = "Abura-sumashi"
short_description = "Abura-sumashi – Creature from a mountain pass in Kumamoto Prefecture."
long_description = "This spirit, which surprises people on the Kusazumigoe mountain pass, is thought to be the ghost of a human who stole oil.      In the days before electricity, oil was a very valuable commodity, necessary for lighting and heating a house. As such, the theft of oil, particularly from temples and shrines, could lead to punishment via reincarnation as a yōkai.  In modern media the abura-sumashi is often depicted as, 'a squat creature with a straw-coat covered body and a potato-like or stony head,' an appearance inspired by the artwork of Shigeru Mizuki."
